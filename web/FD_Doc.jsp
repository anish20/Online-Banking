            <p>
              All Banks in India (including SBI, PNB, BoB, BoI, Canara Bank, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank etc.)  offer fixed deposits schemes with a wide range of tenures for periods from 7 days to 10 years.   These are also popularly known as FD accounts.   However, in some other countries these are known as "Term Deposits" or even called "Bond".    The term "fixed" in Fixed Deposits (FD) denotes the period of maturity or tenor. Therefore, the depositors  are supposed to continue such Fixed Deposits for the  length of time for which the depositor decides to keep the money with the bank.  However, in case of need,  the depositor can ask for closing (or breaking) the fixed deposit prematurely by paying paying a penalty (usually of 1%, but some banks either charge less or no penalty).   (Some  banks   introduced variable interest fixed deposits.  The rate of interest on such deposits  keeps on varying with the prevalent market rates i.e. it will go up if market interest rates goes and it will come down if the market rates fall.  However, such type of fixed deposits have not been popular till date).
