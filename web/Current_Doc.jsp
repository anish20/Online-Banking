              Current Accounts are basically meant for businessmen and are never used for the purpose of investment or savings.  These deposits are the most liquid deposits and there are no limits for number of transactions or the amount of transactions in a day.  Most of the current account are opened in the names of firm / company accounts.   Cheque book facility is provided and the account holder can deposit all types of the cheques and drafts in their name or endorsed in their favour by third parties.  No interest is paid by banks  on these accounts.  On the other hand, banks charges certain  service charges, on such accounts.
