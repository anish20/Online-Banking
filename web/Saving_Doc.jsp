                These deposits accounts are one of the most popular deposits for individual accounts.  These accounts not only provide cheque facility but also have  lot of flexibility for deposits and withdrawal of funds from the account.   Most of the banks have rules for the maximum number of withdrawals in a period and the maximum amount of withdrawal, but hardly any bank enforces these.   However, banks have every right to enforce such restrictions if it is felt that the account is being misused as a current account.  Till 24/10/2011, the interest on Saving Bank Accounts was regulared by RBI and it was fixed at 4.00% on daily balance basis.   However, wef  25th October, 2011, RBI has deregulated Saving Fund account interest rates and now banks are free to decide the same within certain conditions imposed by RBI.    Under directions of RBI, now banks are also required to open no frill accounts (this term is used for accounts which do not have any minimum balance requirements).  Although Public Sector Banks still pay only 4% rate of interest, some private banks like Kotak Bank and Yes Bank pay between 6% and 7% on such deposits.  From the FY 2012-13, interest earned upto Rs 10,000 in a financial year  on Saving Bank accounts is exempted from tax.
